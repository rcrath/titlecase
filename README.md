Simple perl oneliner to change text to title case.  I use as a reference for a keyboard shortcut in [CopyQ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ).

You do not need copyq though.

If you have xclip installed, running `./ttl.sh "some random text that understands the principles of a sentence case"` will transform the quoted text to `"Some Random Text that Understands the Principles of a Sentence Case"` and copy that to the system clipboard.

It is made for Linux users. YMMV on other systems.
